                    <h2>Land Rover Range Rover L405</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Don't change it, just make it better. That was the resounding response Land Rover got when it
                        asked
                        existing Range Rover customers what they wanted from the all-new 2013 model. It's been a long
                        time
                        in the making though, facelifts and updates aside, the outgoing Range Rover had been on sale
                        since
                        2002.</p>

                    <p>But Land Rover was never going to risk messing with a winning formula. Since it was first
                        launched
                        more than 40 years ago, the Range Rover has carved out a niche as a luxury 4x4 that's just as
                        happy
                        on Kensington High Street as it is towing horse boxes across muddy fields. It's the ultimate
                        car
                        for the green welly brigade.</p>

                    <p>The styling is a neat continuation of the outgoing model. It takes influence from the Evoque,
                        especially the headlights, yet this is unmistakably a Range Rover with that distinctive
                        profile.</p>

                    <p>The front isn't as upright as before while the side window line now rises so it doesn't look as
                        boxy. But it's still a substantial motor at five metres long and more than two metres wide.
                        When it
                        comes to road presence not much can match it.</p>

                    <p>The most significant changes come under the skin. There's upgraded suspension to provide flatter
                        cornering without adversely affecting ride quality but these improved road manners don't mean
                        compromised off-road ability thanks to upgraded ‘Terrain Response’ technology, which analyses
                        conditions and selects the best settings to cope with them.</p>

                    <p>It's certainly succeeded. No other car, 4x4 or otherwise, can do what the new Range Rover can
                        do. Of
                        course this doesn't come cheap, with prices starting at more than £70,000. But this is the
                        ultimate
                        four-wheel drive vehicle and feels worth every penny.</p>

                    <h2>2015 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> The 2015 Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro packs an impressive list of upgrades for an SUV that is already
                        hugely capable off-road. On board are 17-inch TRD alloy wheels coated in a black finish and
                        wrapped
                        in 31.5-inch Nitto Terra Grappler tires, red Eibach springs, TRD Bilstein shocks with a rear
                        remote
                        reservoir and an additional inch of suspension travel all around, and a TRD aluminum front skid
                        plate. These features complement the 4Runner “Trail” grade’s locking rear differential,
                        automatic
                        traction control system with crawl-assist, multi-terrain selection controls, front and rear
                        ventilated disc brakes, and front and rear stabilizer bars. As for the aesthetics, the 4Runner
                        TRD
                        Pro receives unique badging, black exterior accents, darkened LED taillights, a TRD shift knob
                        and
                        TRD Pro floor mats. For all the above, you’ll have to shell out $41,995, including destination,
                        but
                        as I would discover, the TRD Pro package delivers whatever you ask of it when the road gets
                        rough.
                        n summary, the 4Runner TRD Pro has the hardware to tackle most any terrain.</p>

                    <p> On the highway en route to Big Bear Mountain, the Toyota 4Runner TRD was wonderfully
                        comfortable,
                        with a touch of tire drift and hum as is common with oversized rubber. The brake pedal has a
                        somewhat squishy feel, but foot-to-the-floor and the 4Runner TRD Pro comes promptly to a halt.
                        The
                        hydraulic power steering is quick (2.7 turns lock-to-lock) and accurate, with more than enough
                        feedback for on and off-road purposes. No complaints about the seats either – they were
                        supportive,
                        cushioned for long or short hauls, and once the road became rough, they proved their quality.</p>

                        for.
                        This two-row SUV has a wheelbase longer than the seven-seaters available on the market, so
                        space is
                        not an issue here. The seats are large and comfortable as well to give you good support, be it
                        on
                        highways or when offroading.</p>

                    <p> Its ability to climb anything has been elevated with the addition of adaptive air suspension
                        and
                        Selec-Terrain Management that automatically caters to the powertrain settings for the terrain
                        selected.</p>

                    <p> While the V-8 HEMI looks strong on paper, it’s the 3.0-liter, V-6 turbodiesel engine that
                        steals
                        the show. It has great low-end torque, making it perfectly viable when trying to dodge (pun
                        intended) the boulders and logs. This unit also delivers 30 miles per gallon and has a range of
                        730
                        miles on a full tank. Other engines offered are not that fuel efficient though.</p>

                    <p> Britain's answer to the barrage of bonkers six-wheeled SUVs is the Land Rover Defender Flying

                        Huntsman
                        is a world apart from your average farmyard Defender. The chassis has been stretched by 400mm
                        to
                        accommodate the extra wheels and, rather than an agricultural diesel engine, it’s powered by a
                        monstrous 6.2-litre V8 from General Motors, pumping out 500bhp.</p>

                    <p>Other modifications include a panoramic glass roof, bespoke red leather interior and satin-style
                        paintwork known as Cromax. Expect to pay in the region of £200,000, depending on the options

                    <p>The standard Mercedes G-Wagen is garish enough, but you can go one – or two – better with the G
                        63
                        6x6. The six-wheeled pick-up is the biggest and most extravagant street-legal off-roader the
                        firm
                        has ever produced, at 5.87 metres long and with a kerbweight of well over three tonnes. </p>

                    <p>It was initially developed for the Australian military with a more utilitarian turbodiesel
                        engine,
                        but power for the roadgoing version comes from a hand-built AMG 5.5-litre 537bhp twin-turbo V8,
                        and
                        it’s sent to every wheel in a 30:40:30 configuration. The G 63 also features an on-board
                        compressor, which can raise or lower the tyre pressures to better suit the surface.</p>

                    <h2>Hummer H1</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> The Hummer H1 is a four-wheel-drive utility vehicle based on the M998 Humvee, which was created
                        by
                        AM General. The vehicle was produced from 1992 through 2006, and was the first of what became
                        the
                        Hummer line. Originally designed strictly for military use, the off-road vehicle was released
                        to
                        the civilian market due to market demand. It was initially known as the "Hummer"; however,
                        under a
                        1999 deal, GM bought marketing rights to the Hummer name and called the vehicle the Hummer
                        H1.[2]
                        At the time, GM began marketing the Hummer H2 that was also assembled by AM General on a
                        modified
                        GMC 2500HD chassis. AM General continued to build the H1 and Humvee in its Mishawaka, Indiana
                        facility. GM stopped marketing the H1 in 2006 model year, but AM General continued production
                        of
                        the military Humvee versions. </p>


                    <p> For most Hummer fans, they think of the Humvee that the military used, not the plastic-cladded
                        junkers of the 2000s. In 1992, Hummer civilianized the military vehicle and called it the H1.
                        It
                        featured a huge body, large wheels and tires and near bulletproof construction. Due to their
                        high
                        price tag, not too many of the H1s were made. However, if you can find one, you’ll be able to
                        traverse just about any off-road terrain. Pro tip: If you’re set on owning a Hummer but are
                        only
                        going to keep it on the trails, you may be able to snag a bargain on an ex-military truck at a
                        government auction. </p>

                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">


                    <p>There's more than one way to build a luxury SUV. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class combines a military
                        heritage with modern technology in a brash statement of unconventional luxury. When you want a
                        high-end SUV that doesn't look or feel like anything else on the road, the G-Class is your
                        answer.</p>

                    <p>For 2016, the G550 receives exterior styling tweaks, a new 4.0-liter turbocharged V8 engine and
                        an
                        available adjustable suspension, while a certifiably insane AMG G 65 model joins the lineup
                        with
                        twin-turbo V12 power. The G-Class also receives a new instrument cluster.
                        Vehicle overview
                        The 2016 Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the only vehicle sold today that successfully spans the
                        cultural
                        chasm between Beirut and the Sunset Strip. The "G-Wagen," as it's popularly known, serves
                        civilian
                        owners worldwide, has seen military use on six continents and once won the Dakar Rally. To say
                        it's
                        versatile is a wild understatement. It's also an icon of prosperity that's perhaps uniquely
                        resistant to rational analysis.</p>

                    <p>Along with ancient underpinnings designed for navigating landmine craters, this SUV proffers
                        healthy helpings of leather-wrapped luxury and incongruously contemporary engineering. It's
                        square,
                        it's heavy, it steers and rides like the decades-old military vehicle that it is — and people
                        love
                        it anyway. </p>

                    <p>Practicality and utility aren't high on this SUV's priority list. Mercedes has done an admirable
                        job of polishing the agonizingly old design with modern features, but a few unfortunate
                        fundamentals — poor use of space, awkward drivability and dismal fuel economy — remain central
                        to
                        the G's character. For some buyers that might be the whole point, however. Because this rig
                        makes a
                        statement wherever it goes. </p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Lamborghini is known for making supercars, but the company branched out in the 1980s and built
                        the
                        LM002. It was a big and boxy 4×4 SUV with a huge V12 borrowed from the Countach under the hood.
                        Looking like a sporty version of every off-road SUV that came before it, it had an engine that
                        could blow away most sports cars on the road. Lamborghini did race the LM002 in a few rallys,
                        but
                        most people know the model for its outrageous looks and powerful engine.</p>


                    <p>As if the angry rasp and spit of its old-school V12 engine weren’t foreboding enough to make you
                        recoil, the car’s incredible bulk and science-fiction-mutant styling certainly will – in
                        protection
                        of your internal organs, mainly. In situ at the trough, spluttering away at idle, with
                        superminis
                        and family hatches fleeing in all directions, this thing looks like a cuckoo chick in a robin’s
                        nest: fat, noisy, wild for a feed. </p>

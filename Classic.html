                    <h2>Chevrolet Corvette (1953-1962)</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">



                    <p>The first generation Corvette is the most significant American car ever created. Its stunningly
                        original design and impressive performance, not to mention its potent fuel-injected engines,
                        proved once and for all that America could compete in the sports car arena.</p>
                    <p>In the period of just two short years, Corvette had evolved from a car that was facing the very
                        serious threat of extinction to one that showed real promise for a long and healthy life.</p>
                    <p>While General Motors still recorded only modest sales of the Chevrolet Corvette in 1956, it was
                        apparent to everyone that it was also beginning to be taken seriously as a sports car. Even
                        after the immense structural, physical and mechanical facelift it received in 1956, Corvette
                        saw some major improvements in 1957.</p>
                    <p>A new, larger 283-cid engine was placed under the hood, Mechanically, it was really still the
                        existing 265-cid engine, though it had been bored out 1/8-inch (to 3.875 inches). This modified
                        engine delivered an impressive 220 horsepower when coupled with a four-barrel carburetor. Dual
                        four-barrels took it to 245 horsepower (and 270bhp.) Better still, consumers could now also
                        purchase GM‘s newly developed “Ramjet” fuel injection system which yielded 259 horsepower (or
                        283 bhp).</p>

                    <h2>AC Cobra (1961–1967)</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>The Cobra is one of the most famous, and frequently replicated, cars on the road. Derived from
                        the British AC Ace roadster, the Cobra became an instant classic after Carroll Shelby's
                        thorough reworking.</p>
                    <p>Like many British manufacturers, AC Cars had been using the Bristol straight-6 engine in its
                        small-volume production, including its AC Ace two-seater roadster. This had a hand-built body
                        with a steel tube frame, and aluminium body panels that were made using English wheeling
                        machines. The engine was a pre-World War II design by BMW which by the 1960s was considered
                        dated. Bristol decided in 1961 to cease production of its engine and instead to use Chrysler
                        313 cu in (5.1 L) V8 engines. AC started using the 2.6 litre Ford Zephyr engine in its cars.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>In September 1961, American automotive designer Carroll Shelby wrote to AC asking if they would
                        build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be
                        found. Shelby went to Chevrolet to see if they would provide him with engines, but not wanting
                        to add competition to the Corvette they said no. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete
                        with the Corvette and they happened to have a brand new engine which could be used in this
                        endeavor: the Windsor 221 in³ (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweeight, thin-wall cast small-block
                        V8. Ford provided Shelby with two engines.</p>
                    <p>In 1963 to keep production focused on producing cars for Shelby American Inc., the Ruddspeed Ace
                        was discontinued. To supply cars to the European market, AC began to market and sell the Cobra
                        in Europe. Advertisements from the time state that the Cobra was designed to meet the
                        requirements of Shelby American Inc.</p>

                    <h2>Lamborghini Countach(1971–1990)</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>The Lamborghini About this soundCountach is a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive
                        sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini from 1974 to 1990. It is
                        one of the then-exotic designs conceptualized by Italian Design house Bertone, which pioneered
                        and popularized the sharply angled "Italian Wedge" design language.</p>
                    <p>The development of the Lamborghini Countach was initiated by Ferruccio Lamborghini with the goal
                        of creating a successor to the Lamborghini Miura. The Miura was widely acclaimed after its
                        introduction in 1966, but by 1970 new competitors including the Ferrari Daytona had been
                        released and the Miura was showing its age. Chief engineer Paolo Stanzani and his staff began
                        work on the Miura successor in 1970 under the project name "LP112." From the beginning of the
                        project, Stanzani's collaborators included test driver Bob Wallace, assistant engineer Massimo
                        Parenti and designer Marcello Gandini of Bertone.</p>
                    <p>The Countach name originated in late 1970 or 1971, near the beginning of the LP112
                        project. Most previous and subsequent Lamborghini car names are associated with famous
                        bulls and bullfighting, but the Countach broke with this tradition. The name originated from
                        the word contacc , an exclamation of astonishment in the Piedmontese
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Lamborghini used a system of alphanumeric designations in order to further delineate Countach
                        models.This designation begins with "LP", an abbreviation of the Italian "longitudinale
                        posteriore," meaning "longitudinal rear." This refers to the engine orientation and placement
                        shared by all Countach models. For the prototype and early production models, "LP" was followed
                        by a three digit number designating nominal engine displacement, "400" for 3.9-litre engines
                        and "500" for 4.8 and 5-litre engines. Therefore, the full name of the first production
                        Countach was the Lamborghini Countach LP400. As in the Miura, "S" was added for later high
                        performance variants.[7][11] This naming scheme was disrupted by the 1985 LP5000 Quattrovalvole
                        equipped with a 5.2-litre engine, also called the 5000QV. The LP- designation was dropped
                        entirely for the 1988 25th Anniversary Edition, also called the Anniversary.</p>

                    <h2>Dodge Charger (1968-1969) </h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Many considered the revised 1968-1969 Dodge Charger models to be some of the best-looking
                        mid-size cars around, though the original fastback roofline was replaced by a notchback
                        semi-fastback profile with "flying buttress" sail panels.</p>
                    <p>To satisfy the muscle-car crowd, Dodge released a Charger R/T (for Road/Track) as part of its
                        "Scat Pack," which also included the Coronet R/T and Dart GTS. Each wore bumblebee stripes
                        around its tail and carried an engine appropriate for its title.

                        <p> Ads for "The Clean Machine" (Charger R/T) noted that it was "not built for the common car
                            crowd." For many, that's all it took to induce an insatiable craving for a 440-Magnum V-8
                            and
                            hit 'em hard suspension.</p>

                        <p> Though aimed at "a rugged type of individual," however, Charger ads further noted that the
                            likely buyer was a person "who likes it soft inside." So which was it, ruffian or softy?</p>

                        <p> An aggressive exterior with power to match was enough to pull in the performance boys --
                            especially when abetted by a pair of pipes blaring out the back, and brawny red-sidewall
                            rubber hitting the pavement.</p>

                    <h2>Mercedes-Benz 540K (1935–1940)</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz 500K was introduced in 1934 with the 'K' representing a Kompressor which is
                        German for supercharger. In non-aspirated form, the engine produced 100 horsepower. With the
                        adoption of the Kompressor the horsepower jumped to an impressive 160 making them one of the
                        fastest grand touring cars of their time. The vehicles rode on a 116 inch wheelbase.</p>
                    <p>In 1936 the 540K was introduced which increased power even further. The base version produced
                        115 horsepower while the supercharged increased horsepower to 180. The engine bay was
                        lengthened and the wheelbase was extended by twelve inches which allowed for more stately and
                        elegant vehicles. Chrome accents were used throughout added to the visual appeal. The vehicles
                        were elegant, powerful, and produced in limited numbers. Production continued until 1940 with
                        only 419 examples being produced.</p>
                    <p>A new, larger 283-cid engine was placed under the hood, Mechanically, it was really still the
                        existing 265-cid engine, though it had been bored out 1/8-inch (to 3.875 inches). This modified
                        engine delivered an impressive 220 horsepower when coupled with a four-barrel carburetor. Dual
                        four-barrels took it to 245 horsepower (and 270bhp.) Better still, consumers could now also
                        purchase GM‘s newly developed “Ramjet” fuel injection system which yielded 259 horsepower (or
                        283 bhp).</p>


                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz were among the most desirable and elegant vehicles of their day. They were
                        constructed of the finest materials available. The craftsmanship is legendary and undeniable
                        excellent. Most of the chassis received coachwork by the Mercedes-Benz in-house coachworks
                        facility named the Sindelfingen Body Works. The others were sent to coachbuilders such as
                        Erdmann & Rossi.

                        When completed, the vehicles carried a price tag that only few could afford. During World War
                        II many were hidden and protected along with other priceless works-of-art.

                        Though the 540K models were all built to the same mechanical and chassis configurations, they
                        varied based on their coachwork designs making many unique creations. Configurations varied
                        such as four-seat cabriolets, long-tail roadsters, and high-door luxury styles. The vehicles
                        were tailored to the buyer's requirements and requests.</p>

                    <h2>Chevrolet Impala (1958–1985) </h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>AThe 1958-1960 Chevrolet Impala survived its first three years with aplomb, making major changes
                        after the 1958 model year in a last-minute redesign intended to keep up with the competition.</p>
                    <p>As in past years, the line-topping Chevy was to be the Bel Air, but a new top-of-the-top model
                        was added for 1958. The 1958 Chevrolet Impala arrived in convertible and two-door hardtop form
                        as a subseries of the Bel Air line.</p>
                    <p>Most notable among the Impala's distinctions were its three taillight lenses per side (lesser
                        models had two) and simulated air-extractor vents above the wraparound rear window and on each
                        rear fender. The Impala hardtop had a lower rear roofline than that seen on Bel Air sport
                        coupes.

                        <p>Despite claims of improved ride and handling, the system simply didn't work very well. The
                            basic design was good but the execution was poor; Level Air-equipped Chevrolets suffered
                            from
                            pressure leaks and a host of other maladies. After two years on the market, Level Air
                            vanished
                            unmourned.</p>
                        <p>But the Impala definitely did not vanish. More than 181,000 Impala hardtops and convertibles
                            were sold in the first year, assuring a continuation of the series for 1959 and beyond.</p>

                    coupe, and a production version of the racing 300 SL, complete with the fascinating and now
                    legendary “gullwing” doors, necessitated by the unusual, tall frame design, would be it.</p>

                    <p>The “SL” moniker (translated to English as “Sport Light”) reflected the pioneering use of a welded,
                    tubular-steel, ultra-light frame construction that weighed only 182 pounds. The car also featured
                    fully independent suspension in addition to its fuel-injected, 3.0-liter (2,996-cc), OHC
                    straight-six with dry-sump lubrication, and the motor was inclined to the side in order to reduce
                    the height of the front end. The power, rated at 240 bhp at 6,100 rpm (SAE) and 215 bhp at 5,800
                    rpm (DIN), with the factory-optional or dealer-installed “sport” camshaft, was delivered through a
                    four-speed manual gearbox. A 161-mph top speed and 0–60 acceleration of approximately eight
                    seconds, depending on the rear-end ratio selected from five options, made the 300 SL the fastest
                    production automobile of its time.</p>

                    <p>Appropriate for an automobile that Max Hoffman had almost single-handedly willed into being, the
                    production 300 SL made its debut in the United States, not in Germany, which was a Mercedes first.
                    More than 1,000 of the 1,400 cars produced between 1954 and early 1957 were delivered through
                    Hoffman, to whose showrooms the rich and famous flocked. The 300 SL was also raced and piloted by
                    the top drivers of the day, such as John Fitch, Olivier Gendebien, Paul O’Shea, Prince Metternich,
                    and, of course, Sir Stirling Moss, who holds the “forever” course record for his famous Mille
                    Miglia finish in 1955. It all added to the romance of a car that seemed destined to become a legend
                    the moment production began. It had all of the right ingredients: incredible exclusivity,
                    incredible speed, and an incredible price.</p>

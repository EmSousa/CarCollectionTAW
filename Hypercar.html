                    <h2>McLaren P1</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Where the legendary McLaren F1 was a product of an analogue age, the P1 moves the game on in
                        terms
                        of construction (it features a fully carbon Monocage) and its hybrid powertrain. At its heart
                        is
                        the same 3.8-litre V8 you’ll find in other McLarens but for its P1 application it’s been
                        heavily
                        revised and thanks to its twin-turbos it pushes out 727bhp and 531lb ft. Add the electric motor
                        to
                        the equation and it delivers maximum figures of 903bhp and 664lb ft, enough for a 2.8sec
                        0-62mph
                        time and 0-124mph in just 6.8sec. Quick enough then.</p>

                    <p>But there’s so much more to the P1 than outright speed. You won’t find any fripperies here,
                        everything on the P1 is designed with one purpose in mind – to enhance its performance. It’s
                        clever and well thought out – witness the lack of anti-roll bars whose duties are taken on by
                        McLaren’s Race Chassis Control active dampers. They provide the car with superb control and
                        responses yet endow it with a remarkably smooth ride, a combination with imbibes the driver
                        with huge levels of confidence in the P1’s abilities.</p>


                    <p>It looks dramatic, has an F1-inspired carbonfibre and Alcantara-swathed interior and just about
                        the only downside to the whole package is a modicum of lag from the V8 that the electric motor
                        occasionally struggles to disguise. That and its £866,000 price tag and a production run
                        limited to just 375 examples.</p>

                    <h2>Ferrari Enzo</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Ferrari has a glorious lineage and the Enzo was the distilled essence of its V12 heritage. It
                        was
                        the last of the line of naturally aspirated V12 Ferraris and was a glorious swansong,
                        developing
                        650bhp at 7800rpm and 485lb ft at 5500rpm. In a machine weighing 1480kg it was good enough for
                        a
                        3.1sec 0-62mph time and a top speed of 217mph.</p>

                    <p>If the engine was somewhat old school with no forced induction or electrical assistance to get
                        in
                        the way then the rest of the car was bang up to date with a carbonfibre body, F1-style
                        electro-hydraulic transmission with steering wheel-mounted shift lights and carbon ceramic
                        brakes.</p>

                    <p>But it was the way the Enzo went about its business on the road that was most impressive. The
                        engine’s spine-tingling in both its noise and throttle response and it feels monumentally
                        rapid.
                        This is a sensation enhanced by the transmission which, when in race mode, thumps you in the
                        back
                        as each new ratio engages and is violent enough on down changes to send the car sideways.</p>

                    <p>Its front-end is tenacious and while it can snap into oversteer on the limit it’s not vicious
                        and
                        can be caught without breaking into too much of a sweat even if its steering isn’t quite as
                        telepathic as its Carrera GT contemporary.</p>

                    <h2>Bugatti Chiron</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>If you accept that first and foremost a hypercar has to have epic performance then it should be
                        no
                        surprise that the Chiron is sitting at the top of our hypercar tree. It’s mindwarpingly savage
                        in
                        its acceleration – nothing with four wheels connects corners quite as effectively – perhaps
                        unsurprising given the numbers generated by its quad-turbo W16. 8-litres in capacity and
                        developing
                        an eye-watering 1479bhp and 1180lb ft of torque the Bugatti Chiron dispatches the 0-62mph
                        segment
                        in 2.5sec before crashing through the 124mph barrier a scant four seconds later. Top speed is
                        limited to 261mph.</p>

                    <p> That the Chiron has the high-tech underpinnings to match its outrageous pace should be a given
                        and
                        with a carbonfibre tub reinforced with a sliver of aluminium honeycomb it has the torsional
                        rigidity to match an LMP1 car. Blend in a fully adaptive chassis that optimises ride height,
                        aerodynamics, steering and damping and it has an unexpected level of agility too.</p>
                    <p>The overriding impression though is of speed, pure unadulterated performance, and our only gripe
                        is that there’s hardly anywhere on the planet you can meaningfully exploit its potential. That

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Everything about this hypercar is over the top. It is well known for spitting blue fire flames
                        from the exhaust pipes. This is expected from the huge V12 engine in this hypercar. Lamborghini
                        are well known for building cars that look and perform like jet fighters and the Centenario is
                        one of their most perfect examples of this design language. It's engine produces 770 bhp and
                        will reach 60 mph from a dead stop in only 2.7 seconds.</p>

                    <p>Lamborghini Centenario represents an extremely precious piece in Lamborghini's one-off
                        strategy. It is a perfect example of the innovative design and the engineering skills of the
                        bull-branded manufacturer.
                        The best tribute to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Ferruccio Lamborghini, a man who
                        managed to create a world-class brand, and who always believed that nothing is impossible, thus
                        producing legendary and extraordinary vehicles that made history for super sports cars.
                        The Centenario is an homage to this visionary man and to the future he believed so much in. And
                        we at Lamborghini still believe in that future. Find out more: from the performance to the
                        dimensions to the unique characteristics to the detailed technical specifications of the
                        Lamborghini Centenario.</p>


                    <p>For 1.95 million U.S. dollars you can
                        get your very own Lamborghini Centenario and enjoy the feeling of piloting a road hugging jet
                        fighter.</p>

                    <h2>Koenigsegg Agera RS</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>First it was the McLaren F1, more recently there was the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport but now it’s
                        the turn of the Koenigsegg Agera RS – it’s officially the fastest production car in the world
                        with
                        a top speed of 277.87mph. Prior to its historic top speed run in the Nevada desert the Agera RS
                        had
                        also beaten the Bugatti Chiron’s 0-400-0km/h time – at 36.44 seconds it was over five seconds
                        quicker than the much-vaunted Chiron.</p>

                    <p>It’s an impressive feat from Sweden’s hypercar manufacturer and at the heart of the Agera RS is
                        a
                        5-litre V8 fed by a brace of turbochargers that develops an impressive 1160bhp and 944lb ft.
                        With
                        those outputs it’s no surprise that it’s rapid but elsewhere the Agera RS is similarly cutting
                        edge. </p>

                    <p> Its chassis is carbonfibre and aluminium honeycomb while the shapely body is constructed from
                        carbon and Kevlar. It’s relatively practical for a hypercar too – its removable hardtop can be
                        stowed in the car and there’s an almost usable 150-litre luggage compartment.</p>

                    <p>Just 25 Agera RSs will be built and like most hypercars if you have to ask how much… yup,
                        that’ll
                        be a cool $2 million plus.</p>

                    <h2>Huayra Pagani</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> The Zonda was always going to be a hard act to follow but with the Huayra Pagani managed to
                        combine
                        a new turbocharged engine with the suppleness that was always one of the Zonda’s crowing
                        features.
                        The AMG-sourced 6-litre V12 offers 720bhp and 737lb ft and as the Huayra weighs just 1350kg
                        it’s
                        guaranteed to be quick – 0-62mph takes 3.5sec and top speed is 230mph.</p>

                    <p>There’s real drama to the Huayra’s looks and it’s significantly more cohesive in the flesh than
                        in
                        pictures. Then there’s the slightly bonkers interior, a wonderful amalgam of aluminium, carbon
                        and
                        leather that will no doubt be slightly over the top for some tastes but it’s undeniably
                        dramatic.</p>

                    <p>Performance, traction and grip levels are simply stunning but in the wrong hands it could be a
                        wayward companion as the transition from grip to slip is relatively brutal and not entirely
                        progressive. The slightly heavy steering rack could also do with being quicker. It’s brutally
                        fast
                        when you want it to be but remarkably refined when you notch the pace back a little, too.</p>

                    <p>It’s a pretty convincing package, albeit an expensive one at £820,000 and while the automated
                        single-clutch manual might save weight it’s a little clonky at low speeds.</p>

                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p> Ferrari’s LaFerrari made up the third prong of the hypercar ‘holy trinity’ and like the Porsche
                        918
                        Spyder and the McLaren P1 it used a potent mix of the good, old fashioned internal combustion
                        engine supplemented by an electric motor. Headline figures are mouth-watering. Its 6.3-litre
                        V12
                        revs to 9250rpm and develops 789bhp and 516lb ft of torque with the electric gubbins adding
                        161bhp
                        and 199lb ft.</p>

                    <p>It’s certainly quick enough although Ferrari’s coyness on exact figures seems somewhat
                        ridiculous,
                        quoting times of ‘under 3sec’ for its 0-60mph time and 0-124mph in ‘under 7sec’. The figures
                        are
                        largely academic though as the LaFerrari is dominated by its glorious naturally aspirated V12
                        with
                        the electric motor being used to torque-fill lower down the rev range.</p>

                    <p>With active aerodynamics, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes and a range of F1-derived technology such
                        as
                        F1-trac and an E-diff, the LaFerrari is a hoot to drive with transparent steering and a
                        perfectly
                        judged blend of grip and handling that actually makes it a remarkably driver-friendly hypercar.</p>

                    <p> Downsides? Not many bar a lack of electric-only running and a £1 million price tag – a figure
                        that’s doubled now all 500 examples have been sold.</p>

                </header>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    <P>With ‘only’ 599bhp and 398lb ft developed by its glorious 4.6-litre V8 you could be forgiven for
                        thinking the Porsche 918 Spyder would be a little outgunned in this company. Add in its two
                        electric motors though and the 918 is right up there with 875bhp and a staggering 944lb ft of
                        torque, and it’s that latter figure that stops the 918 Spyder from being significantly
                        outgunned by
                        the other two members of the ‘holy trinity’.</P>

                    <P>It has the performance – 0-62mph in 2.6sec and 0-124mph in 7.2sec – but with the 918 Spyder it’s
                        the seamless way that the four-wheel drive, sublime PDK transmission, twin electric motors and
                        majestic V8 work in combination that makes it such an enjoyable drive. It has impressive eco
                        credentials too – it’ll do 20 miles on pure electric power – but it’s best to remove the roof
                        and
                        revel in that spine-tingling V8 to fully appreciate the 918.</P>

                    <p>o, it’s quick, has a brilliant drivetrain, but it’s the 918’s dynamic ability that’s equally
                        impressive. A brilliant EPAS set up and perfectly judged PASM dampers allow you to fully
                        exploit the Spyder’s four-wheel drive grip yet it’s also surprisingly adjustable, giving you
                        complete confidence in the car.</p>

                    <p> As a complete package the 918 Spyder has few peers and if you were going to contemplate using
                        your hypercar everyday then it would undoubtedly be at the top of your shopping list. You’ll
                        need a £1million plus to join the club though.</p>

                        compared
                        to the latest crop of hypercars but when the Porsche Carrera GT was launched back in 2004 they
                        were
                        right up there with the best the world could offer. Its 5733cc mid-mounted V10 was derived from
                        its
                        Le Mans prototype racers and the rest of the car was equally cutting edge.</p>

                    <p>It had a hand made carbon fibre engine cradle while the springs and dampers are mounted inboard.
                        Stopping was taken care of by carbon-ceramic brakes and that electrically deployed rear spoiler
                        was
                        hugely effective.</p>

                    <p>With the Carrera GT the overriding impression is one of function over style – if it’s fitted to
                        the
                        Porsche it’s there for a purpose, and that purpose is to make the GT faster. The cabin lacks
                        the
                        excesses of some rivals but the pedals and driving position are just about perfect, although
                        its
                        clutch action is unforgiving at low speeds.</p>

                    <p>Drive the Carrera GT hard though and it will reward with a forgiving chassis and communicative
                        steering and that V10’s throttle response is utterly bewitching. The further and the faster you
                        drive it, the more you’ll find layers of ability that weren’t apparent on first acquaintance
                        and a
                        level of dynamic polish that set the hypercar standard.</p>
